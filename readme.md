## Time guessing website

This is a basic website which prompts users to try to guess the amount of time that elapses after a button is pressed. The objective of this website is to learn how to program in react using refs & portals. All the work that is done here is me documenting my progress in the udemy course "React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. React Router & Redux)"
